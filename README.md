# OnChain(WIP)

    Decentralized Application that allows users to store a message on the Ethereum Blockchain Protocol.
    Users can access message anytime through our frontend or other means.
    Once the project is complete I will update this readme to go over the Dapp in depth.
    Big shoutout to (http://truffleframework.com/), excellent resource!
